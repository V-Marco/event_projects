# event_projects

Here are projects I've done for specific formal occasions, events and arrangements.

Generally, these projects were aimed for someone else to work with the code during the actual event, so that the main goal was to ensure that a final user was able to run it. The level of details in the instructions depended on the level of the final user's experience with `Python` and `Jupyter Notebook`. Behind the scenes, the installation of the required libraries was also conducted if needed.

As the projects were used by an organisation, they contained personal information which is ommited in the code presented here. The ommited information is replaced by the '#\*#' literal. All the data sets or files are also private, so that only the code is present.

For the SSFE projects I thank Alpeeva Valeria for the ideas and support.

List of projects:
- `spring_ball.ipynb`: scripts for the SSFE's annual Spring Ball. `vkapi` and `gspread` libraries were used to use Google Sheets as a data organiser, and then compose VK messages based on that data. `vkapi` was also used to create a VK-bot on a free server which notified the administrators on the incoming messages in a convenient way.
